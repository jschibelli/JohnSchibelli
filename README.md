# üí´ About Me

I'm a Senior Front-End Developer who builds scalable, performant, and accessible interfaces‚Äîespecially for real-time collaborative products. I specialize in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, with a strong focus on UI architecture, DX, and system resilience.

Most recently, I led front-end development for SynaplyAI, a collaborative AI content platform. I built token-level conflict resolution, adaptive AI integration, and real-time editing using Yjs, WebSockets, and a fully custom UI layer.

I don‚Äôt just generate code‚ÄîI design interfaces that perform under pressure and scale with users.

I‚Äôm passionate about developer experience, believing that great DX leads to great UX. Whether it's component structure, test automation, or performance tuning, I care about building systems devs love to work in and users trust.
